STATUS OF GNOME15
=================

Gnome15 is currently **not complete maintained**.
The original primary repository has been unavailable since November 2014 due to a hosting server crash.
This fork was made to add a feature and has not been updated since November 2013, but it appears to be the latest snapshot of the repository that is currently publicly available.

I intend to bring this repository up to date with the latest version (the version before the server crash) using the code contained in the latest distribution packages available.
We want to maintain it, so many we can. Feel free to work with.

Contains pylibg19, a library providing support for the Logitech G19 until there
is kernel support available. It was based "Logitech-G19-Linux-Daemon" [1],
